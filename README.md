# Sales-Analytics-Dashboard---Power-Bi

🧭**Project Overview**

An end-to-end Sales Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI to track and visualize an organization's sales performance—covering metrics like sales volume, revenue, market share, trends over time, product/category breakdowns, and regional insights.

## Dataset
- Fact: SalesOrders.csv with Date, ProductID, UnitsSold, Revenue, Cost, etc.
- Dim: Products (Category), Stores (Region), Date dimension.

## Business Questions
1. Monthly & quarterly sales trends
2. Top 10 products by sales & margin
3. Regional performance & map view
4. YoY and rolling 12M market share
5. Identifying slow-moving / high-return products

## Approach

- Visualizations: line charts, treemaps, cards, map visuals
